Hi, my name is Frenel. I'm a fourth year computer science student at the College of Engineering Trivandrum.
My hobbies are hackathons and playing football.
I got a job at Dissern Security and I'll be joining in May of 2025
and I'll also be graduating in June or July of 2025.
With my degree in computer science, I went to school in Trivandrum in Kerala at Sarvodeh, Vidyalaya.
But I also grew up in the U.S. and I spent around eight years in the U.S.
And this is a voice clone for PlayHT.
