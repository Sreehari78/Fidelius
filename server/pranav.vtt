Hi, my name is Frenel. I'm a fourth year computer science student at the College of Engineering Trivandrum.

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
My hobbies are hackathons and playing football.

00:09.000 --> 00:15.000
I got a job at Dissern Security and I'll be joining in May of 2025

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
and I'll also be graduating in June or July of 2025.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
With my degree in computer science, I went to school in Trivandrum in Kerala at Sarvodeh, Vidyalaya.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
But I also grew up in the U.S. and I spent around eight years in the U.S.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
